# animal_adoption_app

A Flutter project named Cuddler. 
Cuddler allows users to connect with their fur-ever pets by viewing profiles, adding liked pets to a user list, and storing session information when they log in and out. Users can also list a pet for adoption into the database so that animals can be united with their human parents sooner. 

## How To Use

When loaded onto a virtual phone emulator or downloaded to a mobile device, log in with any of the following users:
justin@bieber.com (password: 12345)
hunter@gmail.com (password: hunter)
barbie@gmail.com (password: pewdiepie)
and navigate through the pages as you see fit....

Be warned that some of the functionality at this moment is not accessible and Placeholder widgets maintain the code.

The Flutter SDK or Android Studio should allow you to run the code on an ADV machine.
